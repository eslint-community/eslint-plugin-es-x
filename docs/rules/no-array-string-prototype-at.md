# es-x/no-array-string-prototype-at
> disallow the `{Array,String}.prototype.at()` methods

- 🚫 This rule was deprecated and replaced by [es-x/no-array-prototype-at](./no-array-prototype-at.md),[es-x/no-string-prototype-at](./no-string-prototype-at.md) rules.

This rule reports ES2022 [`{Array,String,TypedArray}.prototype.at` methods](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-relative-indexing-method) as errors.

This rule is silent by default because it's hard to know types. You need to configure [the aggressive mode](../#the-aggressive-mode) or TypeScript in order to enable this rule.

## 💡 Examples

⛔ Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

<eslint-playground type="bad">

```js
/*eslint es-x/no-array-string-prototype-at: [error, { aggressive: true }] */
foo.at(-1)
'str'.at(-1)
```

</eslint-playground>

## 🔧 Options

This rule has an option.

```yaml
rules:
  es-x/no-array-string-prototype-at: [error, { aggressive: false }]
```

### aggressive: boolean

Configure the aggressive mode for only this rule.
This is prior to the `settings['es-x'].aggressive` setting.

## 🚀 Version

This rule was introduced in v5.0.0.
