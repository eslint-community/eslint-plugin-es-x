# es-x/no-string-prototype-includes
> disallow the `String.prototype.includes` method

- âœ… The following configurations enable this rule: `plugin:es-x/no-new-in-es2015`, `plugin:es-x/restrict-to-es3`, and `plugin:es-x/restrict-to-es5`

This rule reports ES2015 `String.prototype.includes` method as errors.

This rule is silent by default because it's hard to know types. You need to configure [the aggressive mode](../#the-aggressive-mode) or TypeScript in order to enable this rule.

## ðŸ’¡ Examples

â›” Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

<eslint-playground type="bad">

```js
/*eslint es-x/no-string-prototype-includes: [error, { aggressive: true }] */
foo.includes("a")
```

</eslint-playground>

## ðŸ”§ Options

This rule has an option.

```yaml
rules:
  es-x/no-string-prototype-includes: [error, { aggressive: false }]
```

### aggressive: boolean

Configure the aggressive mode for only this rule.
This is prior to the `settings['es-x'].aggressive` setting.

## ðŸš€ Version

This rule was introduced in [eslint-plugin-es] v5.0.0.
